**This experiment is divided into two parts:

Circuit soldering
Program coding
Please collaborate on this tasks to complete the experiment as quickly as possible.

**Bring the two types of dividers you have learned before (one for direct division and the other for dividing by the input). We will use them.

**Review the previous learning on "asynchronous counter":
always@(posedge clk or posedge rst)

**When soldering the circuit, please be careful and do not play around to avoid burning yourselves or your classmates.

**When soldering the circuit, please carefully review the circuit diagram before starting. Our equipment is limited, and if there are issues with the soldering, it can be troublesome for the equipment supply. So, please make sure to understand the circuit before starting the work.
