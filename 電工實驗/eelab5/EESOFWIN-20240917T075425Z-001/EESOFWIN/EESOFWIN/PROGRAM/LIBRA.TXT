**********************************************************************

I. Installing Touchstone or Libra for Windows and the Software Key

Touchstone and Libra for Windows, version 2.0, run on Windows 3.1,
using the Microsoft Win32s operating subsystem. This Operating Subsysten
is included on the Libra for Windows and Touchstone for Windows disk
ship set and is instaled when you install the application.

When you launch the Setup program, the operating system is automatically 
detected.  If you launched from Windows 3.1, the required Win32s subsystem
will be installed in your Windows 3.1 Directory.

The Touchstone or Libra for Windows distribution set consists of three
3.5-inch, high-density floppy disks, four transistor S-parameter data files
disks plus a software key distribution disk, which may be supplied
separately.

In addition, a Rainbow SENTINEL SuperPro hardware key must be
installed or the program will launch in Demo mode, providing limited
functions and the ability to read only coded .cky files.

1.  To install the Rainbow hardware key:
	
    If your operating system is 16-bit Windows 3.1, simply plug the
    hardware key into the LPT1 parallel port.
   
    If your operating system is 32-bit Windows, you must install
    the Rainbow SENTINEL SuperPro driver.  Refer to the text file,
    rainbow.txt, which is contained on disk 3, for instructions on how
    to do this.

2.  To install Touchstone or Libra for Windows (plus LineCalc, TS2ACAD,
    and the S- parameter transistor data files) from the MS-DOS prompt:
     
    A.  With the computer on, insert Disk 1, the Install Disk, in the
	appropriate drive.
    B.  At the MS-DOS prompt, type the drive letter that contains the
	Install Disk, followed by a colon (:); then press Return.
	For example: C> a:
    C.  Type "win setup" and press Return.
    D.  Windows 3.1 will be launched and the setup program loaded.
    E.  Follow the on-screen prompts to install the additional program disks.

3.  To install Touchstone or Libra for Windows (plus LineCalc, TS2ACAD,
    and the S- parameter transistor data files) from the Windows
    Program Manager:
    
    A.  Select Run from the File menu.
    B.  Enter "A:\setup" in the Command Line box, where "A" is the logical
	drive letter of the floppy drive you are using.
    C.  Choose the OK button.

4.  To install the software key from the MS-DOS prompt:
   
    A.  With the computer on, insert the software key disk in the appropriate drive.
    B.  At the MS-DOS prompt, type the drive letter that contains the disk,
	followed by a colon (:); then press Return.
	For example: C> a:
    C.  Type "win eesofkey libra" and press Return.

5.  To install the software key from the Windows Program Manager:
   
    A.  Choose Run from the File menu.
    B.  Enter "a:\eesofkey libra" in the Command Line dialog box.
    C.  Choose the OK button.

    The file eesof.key is installed to the ...\eesofwin\program directory.

Note: Verify that the serial number on the hardware key matches
    the serial number indicated on the software key distribution disk.
    If the serial numbers of the two keys do not match, the program will
    launch in Demo mode.


*********************************************************************

II. Configuring Your System

Note: The following does not apply if you are using the Windows NT
operating system.

At an absolute minimum, your CONFIG.SYS file should contain the
following command lines:

1.  A command line for an extended-memory manager such as HIMEM.

	Examples: DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS

HP EEsof Windows-based product will not run using expanded memory.

To use extended memory, all HP EEsof Windows-based products require HIMEM
or a compatible memory manager.  When you installed Windows, the
Microsoft Setup program installed HIMEM and added the HIMEM command
line to your CONFIG.SYS file.  So, unless you deleted it, this necessary
command line is probable already there.

2.  A files command line setting files to at least 60; i.e., FILES=60.

Touchstone or Libra for Windows requires a large number of file handles for
such things as buffers, pens, brushes, fonts, storage files and data arrays.
If you do not allocate enough file handles using the files command,
the program may not operate properly.

Keep in mind that each grid and each Performance and/or Sensitivity
Histogram bin defined in the CKT file requires a handle.  If you intend
to use a lot of grids and/or histogram bins, the files number should be
increased accordingly.

3.  The buffers command line should be set to BUFFERS=30.

4.  A shell command line specifying which command interpreter is to be
used when you switch to the MS-DOS prompt.  For example, if your
MS-DOS files are located in the DOS directory on drive C, the shell
command line should read:

	SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM /P /E:2048

5.  A stacks command line setting 9 stacks of 512 bytes each.  For example:

	STACKS=9,512

When you installed Windows, the Microsoft Setup program added this
stacks command line to your CONFIG.SYS file.  So, unless you deleted it,
this necessary command line is probable already there.

6.  An Example CONFIG.SYS file follows:

	DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	DOS=HIGH 
	DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS 
	FILES=60
	BUFFERS=30
	BREAK=ON
	SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM /P /E:2048
	STACKS=9,512


*********************************************************************

III.  Notes on the MS-DOS Function SHARE.EXE

In a multitasking operating system such as Windows 3.x, there can be 
file-sharing problems if an application allows multiple instances or leaves 
files open.  A file-sharing utility is needed to restrict access to open 
files and to temporarily deny another program access to those files, so that 
one program is not trying to read a file at the same time another program is 
trying to write to it.

Windows for WorkGroups running in enhanced mode loads and uses a VxD 
version of Microsoft's SHARE function called VSHARE.386.  VSHARE.386 is 
loaded by a reference to device=vshare.386 in the [386Enh] block of the 
Windows system.ini file. Although it is possible to run most programs without 
SHARE, Microsoft does not recommend it. However, there may be a serious 
problem with the SHARE environment switches.  

If you do not specify enough space to store all the file names or enough 
lock files, you may encounter a File Sharing Violation Error.

In several of its release notes, Microsoft recommends setting 
	space to 4096, and
	locks to 500.

Syntax: SHARE [/f:space][/L:locks]
	   where
	      space = storage area to record shared file names
		      Each open file requires full path name + 11 bytes
		      Default is 2048 bytes
	      locks = Max number of file that can be locked. 
		      Default is 20

In a PRB relative to Access entitled "Low Number of Share Locks Can Cause 
Error Messages", PSS ID Number Q96904, Microsoft states:

    "Be sure that the number of share locks is set to 500 or more.  The number 
    of share locks is set by the /L:xxxx parameter when SHARE.EXE is invoked, 
    usually in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, as follows:

	    LOAD C:\DOS\SHARE.EXE /L:500

    The Microsoft Access Setup program modifies your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and sets 
    the number of share locks to 500, but some other program may alter that value.

    Although 500 share locks are sufficient for most Microsoft Access 
    applications, some applications may have problems related to the number of
    share locks.  You may need to gradually increase the number of share locks 
    until these problems disappear.  Try to add as few share locks as possible,
    since each share lock uses memory."

If the  number of lock files is set to some large value, the space allocated 
to store the file names obviously must  be includes accordingly.  This value 
should be the anticipated length of the full path file name + 11 times the 
number of lock files allowed.

The use of VSHARE.386 overcomes the not-enough-locks problem, since it 
dynamically allocates the number of locks available based of the demand 
for them.  


*********************************************************************

IV.  Memory and Swap Files

Touchstone and Libra for Windows are written using 32-bit code and are
compiled using the Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit compiler into a single huge 
segment containing both code and data.  When the programs are first 
launched, this segment occupies about 7.5 Mbytes.

As it runs simulations, arrays are created in the code/data segment, which
cause it to grow.  The level of growth  depends on the circuit being simulated,
the number of frequency points and measurements being made, and the number of
variables being optimized or varied in a yield analysis.  10 to 12 Mbytes 
is not unusual. An extremely large simulation can take 60 MBytes or more.

The segment will grow up to all the available memory in your machine.

Windows will keep giving Libra space by moving the code segments and
resources of other programs (including Windows itself) to Swap Files
(if you have defined them) until it can't do it any more.  At that point,
Libra will probably crash.

If you experience system crashes when running large simulations,
optimizations, or yield analyses, close all other applications except 
Touchstone or Libra for Windows and the Microsoft Windows Program Manager.

If you still crash, increase the size of your Swap File.

If you still crash, your only solution is to add more RAM memory

It is recommended that you review the chapter in the Windows manual 
concerning swap files.  A permanent swap file on your hard disk of at 
least 8 Mbytes is recommended.

Keep in mind that the memory indication presented in the  "About Program 
Manager" box includes the virtual memory in the Swap File.  (To view this 
box, select Help > About Program Manager.)

V.  Installing Win32s Directives

Before attempting to run your HP EEsof Windows software, you must verify that
two lines were automatically inserted in the Windows system.ini file during 
your program installation. The lines, which are required for the Win32s 
Operating Subsystem to run, are as follows:

[boot]
device=mmsystem.dll winmm16.dll

[386Enh]
device=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WIN32S\w32s.386

The "C:\WINDOWS" portion of the above string is the location of the Windows
directory and may vary depending on where you actually installed Windows.

Important notes: 

    1.  Every time the installation program writes to the system.ini file, an 
	automatic backup file called system.old is created. This file is saved 
	to the "windows" directory of your root drive.

    2,  Although the Touchstone or Libra for Windows installation program inserts 
	these directives for you, there may be a problem caused by other 
	applications that also use Win32s. These lines might be inserted in an 
	inappropriate manner.

    3.  The Win32s VxD directive w32s.386 must be loaded only once. If a 
	reference to the w32s.386 VxD is included more than once, Windows will 
	not start and will give the user an error message that the VxD has 
	already been loaded.

    4.  Microsoft's system.ini parser is not case-sensitive, so these directives 
	can be in either upper or lower or mixed case.  It also doesn't care 
	about leading blank spaces or spaces on either side of the equal sign 
	following the key word "device".

All of the following directives are valid in any combination of case:

[386Enh]
device=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WIN32S\w32s.386
     device=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WIN32S\w32s.386
device     =C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WIN32S\w32s.386
device=     C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WIN32S\w32s.386
device     =     C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WIN32S\w32s.386

The installation program for Touchstone or Libra for Windows looks for all 
these variations of the w32s.386 directive trying to make sure that only one 
valid one is included. However, some other program installing the Win32s 
Operating  Subsystem may not have followed the rules and this directive could 
be in the system.ini file in some unanticipated form.

If, after installing Touchstone or Libra for Windows, Windows 3.1 will not 
start and gives you the error message about a VxD being already loaded at 
some address, review the system.ini file using any ASCII text editor, such as 
EDIT.EXE.  If you find the w32s.386 directive included more than once, delete 
one of the device=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WIN32S\w32s.386 statements and restart 
Windows.  This should clear the problem.


*********************************************************************

VI. Win32s Operational Notes

The problems listed below occur when using the Win32s Operating Subsystem, 
which is necessary to convert the native 32-bit code used in Libra for 
Windows to the 16-bit code used by Windows 3.1.

These problems do not occur when using Microsoft Windows NT, Version 3.1.
If they are a limitation for you, we suggest you use the 32-bit Microsoft 
Windows NT instead of the 16-bit Windows 3.1.

MDI stands for Multiple Document Interface.  Touchstone and Libra for Windows
use the MDI protocol for the EditFile, SCN, GR and SC windows.  

1.  Maximized MDI Window may hide dialog box 

When operating under the Win32s Operating Subsystem, a maximized MDI window 
may hide a Message or dialog box waiting for your input.  If the  program 
seems to be hung, none of the visible title bars are highlighted  
(i.e., active) and a "beep" sounds each time you press a key or click on the  
mouse, try pressing "Alt". If there is a hidden message or dialog box under 
the maximized MDI window, it should be brought to the top.


2.  Maximized MDI Window will prevent launch of Help Window

When operating under the Win32s Operating Subsystem, a maximized MDI
window  prevents the Help system from being launched.  If you desire online
help while any one of the MDI windows is maximized, it must first be restored.  
This can be done be clicking on the double arrow in the upper right hand 
corner of the MDI window.

If you don't restore a maximized MDI window before invoking online help, 
Touchstone or Libra for Windows will do it for you.

3.  Maximized MDI Window and the "Alt Tab" O/S Speed Key

When operating under the Win32s Operating Subsystem, the O/S speed key
"Alt Tab", which can normally be used for switching between launched 
applications, doesn't work properly if one of the MDI Windows is maximized.
The Win32s O/S will hang.  

The only way to recover from this hang is to restart the computer, either
by turning it off and back on or by using the "Alt Ctrl Delete" key 
combination.

It is suggested that you restore any maximized MDI window before you use
the "Alt Tab" key combination to switch between applications.

If you don't restore a maximized MDI window, the Tools menu item in the 
Touchstone or Libra for Windows Main Menu will do it for you.


*********************************************************************

VII.  Transistor Data File Directory
	 
When you install your Touchstone or Libra for Windows software, a set of 
S-parameter data files from various manufacturers are installed under your 
installation directory as follows: 
		  .../eesofwin/tdata. 

When you reference an S-parameter data file  (*.s?p) in a circuit file, the 
data file must be located in this directory to successfully perform a 
simulation.


*********************************************************************

VIII.  Corrections to Manual Set

IMPORTANT:  The set of circuit file examples that are installed in the 
example subdirectories on your system during program installation are the 
most recent versions of these files.  They include the latest corrections 
and more detailed annotations and comments than those shown in the 
procedural chapters and the example appendices of the Touchstone & Libra
for Windows Applications manual.


1.  Circuit Element Catalog:  

    A.  For the TAPIND2 element on page 12-25, the Range of Usage equation 
	should  read as follows:
	  "L is greater than or equal to (N1 + N2) * WD, 
	   where WD is the wire diameter."

    B.  Chapter 8, Measurement-Related Elements.
	 
	DPWRSMP element, page 8-2:
	The scattering matrix for this element that is shown in the manual
	is not complete.  The correct matrix is as follows:

		   0  1  0  0
		   1  0  0  0
		   1  0  0  0
		   0  1  0  0   
     
	TP element:
	The test point element (TP_xxx), not included in the manual,  is
	also available.

	Syntax:  TP_xxx    n
	Parameters:  _xxx  =      required identifier tag
	n      =    node to which it is connected

	Netlist Example:  TP_Ttest1   12
	Element Type:  Electrical element model; symbolic test point
	Model Basis: Ideal; Originator:  HP EEsof
	Range of Usage:  Libra with Advanced Schematic option

	TP Note 1:  This element is primarily intended for use with Libra in 
	conjunction with the Advanced Schematic option.  Each user-named 
	test-point element is interpreted by the program as a connection to a 
	specific node in the circuit.  Thus, a unique test point name, rather 
	than the number, identifies the nodes.

	TP Note 2:  This element can be connected anywhere in the circuit and 
	does not affect circuit performance.

	TP Note 3:  A TP element name may be specified in place of a node 
	number (as TP_xxx) in the HBCNTL block and in a nonlinear measurement 
	specified in the OUT, OPT, YIELD, or OUTVAR block.

    C.  Chapter 9, Microstrip Elements.

	Several elements in this chapter include a note about impedance 
	dispersion options, referring you to Chapter 2 of the same book.  The 
	correct reference for this information should be to your Touchstone & 
	Libra for Windows Reference manual, Chapter 10, Menus & Commands, in 
	the sections titled "Commands for Element Model Options."

    D.  On page 13-21, VCVS element, under Range of Usage, the Setting and 
	Result columns shown for the R2 parameter should both show a value of 
	zero (0).  The result is not infinity.

2.  Applications Manual

    A.  Chapter 10, Modifying Linear Circuit File for nonlinear measurements

	In Chapter 10, in the section, "Modifying linear circuit file for 
	nonlinear measurements," there are several corrections: 

	On page 10-4, step 3. First line of the source block should read: 
	       OSC1 VS_DVDD  20  0  DC=5 .

	On page 10-5, the final sentence in step 5 should read: 
	  "The power output at the fundamental PF, output spectrum PS, 
	   and output voltage V, are also provided."

	On page 10-6, step 1 in  the procedure to adjust Vin (bottom page) 
	should read: 
	  "Adjust the value of PWR while viewing GR2 and performing RF Sweep 
	   in the split-screen mode."

	On page 10-6, step 2 in  the procedure to adjust Vin  (bottom  page) 
	should read: 
	  "Change PWR until the MAG[R] is < 1.03."

	On page 10-10, the zero reactance crossing value shown in the final 
	paragraph on the page should be 16.55 GHz.
   
3.  Reference Manual
 
    A.  Tune Bar Commands
		
	The Field Tuning commands to increase or decrease the values of 
	tunable parameters in the tune bar are described on page 7-4. The 
	command actions listed there are not correct. The correct uses of the 
	tune bar buttons and the keyboard arrow key are as follows:

	Clicking on the top arrow button on the tune bar  increases the 
	selected parameter by  1%.
 
	Clicking on the bottom arrow button on the tune bar decreases the 
	selected parameter by  1%.

	Pressing the Shift key while clicking on the top arrow button on the 
	tune bar increases the selected parameter by  10%.

	Pressing the Shift key while clicking on the bottom arrow button on 
	the tune bar decreases the selected parameter by  10%.

	Pressing the up-arrow key on the keyboard increases the selected
	parameter by  1%.

	Pressing the down-arrow key on the keyboard decreases the selected
	parameter by  1%.

	Additional tips:

	   1.  If the Edit window is active and you wish to activate the 
	       tune bar instead, press Enter.

	   2.  You can move from left to right across the tune bar fields by 
	       pressing the tab key or by clicking on the appropriate field.

	   3.  To sweep the circuit after you have entered all desired new 
	       parameter values,  either click on the tune bar or press Enter. 
  
    B.  File > Print > Collate Copies command
	      
	On page 10-8, the Collate Copies button in the Print dialog box is 
	described.  This dialog box is accessed by selecting Print from the 
	File menu. This command is not operative in Touchstone or Libra for 
	Windows.

    C.  Screen to ClipBoard Command

	On page 10-9, please note that this command is a Windows Operating 
	System command.  It cannot be invoked from the File Menu.  It can 
	only be invoked from the keyboard by pressing either the PrintScreen 
	or Alt-PrintScreen key. 

    D.  Window to ClipBoard Command

	On page 10-9, the notation "(Print Screen)" pertains to the Screen to
	ClipBoard command, not the Window to ClipBoard Command.  The correct 
	speed key for the Window to ClipBoard Command is Alt F12. Please note 
	that this command is a Windows Operating System command.  It cannot 
	be invoked from the File Menu.

    E.  RF Sweep command
       
	On pages 10-17 and 10-21, the RF Sweep command is described. The 
	first time you start the program, the graphical outputs will not be 
	displayed as icons. The outputs will be displayed in a tiled 
	arrangement. Options for bringing the outputs up as icons, in a 
	cascaded arrangement,  or back to a tiled arrangement, are all
	selected in the Grid Display command from the Options menu.

    F.  Layout command

	On pages 10-23 and 10-24, the commands in the Tools menu are 
	described.  There is an additional command that can be selected. The 
	Layout command brings up the TS2ACAD program, which is a 
	netlist-to-DXF layout translator that is an optional purchase to 
	Touchstone or Libra for Windows.

    G.  Grid Display command

	On page 10-26, the Grid Display command is described. This command 
	allows you to pre-select the way your screen will be arranged to show 
	graphic outputs following a sweep. The options available for this 
	command are different from those shown. The three options are: 
	
	    1.  Tile After Sweep  - show each grid and tabular
		data in separate sections of the screen
	
	    2.  Iconize After Sweep - bring up each grid
		and the tabular data as a separate icon at the bottom of your 
		screen
	    
	    3.  Cascade After Sweep - bring up all grid and tabular outputs in 
		a cascaded arrangement

    H.  Text > Background Color command

	On pages 10-29 and 10-30, the Color dialog box used to modify the 
	background colors of your text windows (Edit and SCN) is described. 
	The box differs from the pictures and the description in the manual 
	as follows:

	    1.  The name of the  dialog has been changed to "Edit File and 
		SCN Background Color Selection."   
	    
	    2.  The Define Custom Colors button, which formerly expanded the 
		dialog box, has been removed. When the box first comes up, it is 
		already in a wider format with additional fields, similar to 
		the picture shown on page 10-30.
 
	    3.  The display that was formerly called Color/Solid is now 
		called SCN/Edit Background. This display shows you how a 
		color that you have selected will appear in the SCN Window 
		(left side of display) and the Edit Window right side of 
		display). In some cases, the appearance will be the same. 

    I.  Text > Font command
    
	On page  10-28, the dialog box used to modify the font attributes of 
	your text windows (Edit and SCN) is described. In the illustration in 
	the manual, the dialog box is labeled "Font." However, the current 
	correct name for this dialog box is "Edit File and Screen Font 
	Selection."

    J.  Options > Sound command
    
	On page 10-24, the description of the menu choices for the Sound 
	command shows five selections. In the current version of the program, 
	only Muted and Beep sound settings are available from this menu.    

    K.  View Menu       
    
	The View Menu is not included in Chapter 10, Menus & Commands, of the
	Torchstone and Libra dor Windows Reference Manual.  For information 
	on using this menu item, refer to Chapter 2, Before You Begin, of the
	Touchstone & Libra Windows Getting Started Manual.
	
    L.  Autoranging

	On pages 3-13/3-14 and 4-21/4-22 reference is made to Autoranging.
	Autoranging is not implemented in Libra for Windows, Version 2.0.
